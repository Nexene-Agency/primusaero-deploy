# Styles

This folder contains all the stylesheets for the application. It is
important to know, that the server-side pages (practically everything
under the app/[locale] folder) will be rendered as static HTML/JS/CSS
files during build time, so only vanilla CSS can be used.

## brand.css

The brand-related values.

## fonts.css

The font definitions.
